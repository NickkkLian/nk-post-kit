description: Turn a finished repository, tool or skill into a set of posts a person publishes by hand — a short X post, a 400–800 word build log, a 5–10 minute video script, a 60–90 second vertical cut, a GIF recording script, and a Chinese Xiaohongshu version — every claim traced to a file or a real run, with a gate that blocks invented numbers, superlatives, private names and contact details. Use when something is shipped and needs to be shown, when drafting a weekly build log, or when a demo GIF is needed without screen recording. scripts/termgif.py renders a scripted terminal session to a GIF, and scripts/preview_cards.py draws the thread and the Chinese post as image cards, so length, wrapping and the cover line are seen before anything goes out. Not an auto-poster: nothing is published by the skill.
license: MIT
compatibility: termgif.py and preview_cards.py need Pillow (pip install pillow); termgif needs a monospace TrueType font and preview_cards needs a font with Chinese glyphs (macOS has one; elsewhere pass --cjk-font). postkit_check.py is stdlib only.

# Post kit

**A post about something you built is believed for the same reason the thing is: the claims can be checked.**
The failure mode is not bad writing; it is a number nobody measured, a "used by" nobody counted, or an
incident retold so smoothly that it no longer matches what happened. This skill writes six pieces from the
repository and its evidence, and a gate refuses the drafts that drift from it.

> **Paths.** Commands in this skill start with `${…SKILL_DIR}`: this skill's own folder, the one that contains this SKILL.md. Claude Code fills it in. If your agent shows the placeholder as written (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and others), replace it with that folder's absolute path before you run the command. Left as it is, it expands to nothing and the path breaks.

## When this applies

- A repository, tool or skill is finished and needs a post, a thread, a video or a GIF.
- A weekly build log is due and the material is scattered across commits and test output.
- A demo GIF is needed and screen recording is not practical (CI, remote machine, no GUI).

## Procedure

1. **Collect the sources first** into `post-kit/story-source.md`: one line per claim you intend to make, with
   the file or command output it comes from. A claim with no source line does not go in any piece.
2. **Record a real run** that shows before and after: write `post-kit/gif-script.sh` (prepare a sample in a
   temp dir → run the "before" where nothing is caught → run the tool → show the catch → clean up), run it,
   and save its raw output to `post-kit/gif-run.txt` ending with the real exit code.
3. **Write the six pieces** from `references/template.md`: `x-post.md` (root ≤ 280 with **no** link, plus a `## Reply 1` block ≤ 280 that carries the link and the licence),
   `build-log.md` (400–800 words: the incident, why the usual approach misses it, what the tool does, before
   and after with a real output excerpt, what it does not check, install), `youtube-script.md` (5–10 minutes,
   table of segment / duration / on screen / narration; cold open on the moment it goes red),
   `vertical-cut.md` (3–5 segments from the long script, 60–90 seconds, first second is the catch),
   `xiaohongshu.md` (Chinese: cover line ≤ 16 characters stating the before/after difference, 300–900
   characters of body, something concrete in the first 300, the things that must be said gathered into one
   section, no contact details).
4. **Render the GIF without recording**: turn the run into a cast (`$ command` lines are typed, other lines
   printed, `#pause: s`, `#title: …`) and run
   `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/termgif.py demo.cast --out demo.gif --png poster.png --cols 88 --rows 18`.
   Or straight from the run: `--from-run post-kit/gif-run.txt --replace "/long/local/path=~/tool" --max-block 8`.
   Look at the PNG before publishing it.
5. **Look at the cards before the gate**:
   `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/preview_cards.py . --out post-kit/preview`
   draws the root post and the reply with their character counts, the cover line at cover size, and the body
   paginated over 3:4 cards. Read them. A file cannot show that the cover line is too long to read at a glance,
   that a paragraph wraps into a wall, or that the last line falls off the card; the picture can. Neither
   platform renders Markdown, so the cards drop `**` and `##` — what you see is what a reader gets.
6. **Gate the kit**: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/postkit_check.py . --private-words ~/.config/post-kit/private-words.txt`
   (P1 all pieces present · P2 X length/hashtags/link · P3 word count · P4 Chinese cover/body/contacts ·
   P5 job-hunting words, superlatives, local paths, your private words · P6 the run exited 0 · P7 video length ·
   P8 framings that read as facts and are not · P9 story-source.md says what the kit does not claim).
   `--x-only` narrows it to the pieces a thread release actually publishes.
   Keep the private-words file outside every repository; it lists exactly what must not be published.
7. **A person publishes.** The skill drafts and checks; posting stays a human action.

## Rules that keep it honest

- Numbers come from evidence files or self-test output, quoted as they appear. "About 7,500" in a doc and
  "7,597" in a replay log are different claims; use the one you can point at.
- Incidents are told by their shape — the command, the output, what went wrong — not by which project.
- Describe a tool by what it solves, the before/after difference, and its boundaries. No "revolutionary",
  no "one-click", no adoption numbers without a source.
- The "before" in a demo must be a real run, not a strawman built to lose.

## Boundaries

- The gate checks shape and red-line words; it cannot tell whether a sentence is true. The story-source file
  and a reviewer are for that.
- termgif renders text frames; it does not capture real GUIs. For interface demos, record the screen and
  convert with ffmpeg.
- The Chinese checks count characters and look for contact patterns; they do not judge tone.
- A preview card is this skill's own drawing, not a screenshot of X or Xiaohongshu: the fonts and the
  line breaks are close, not identical. It answers how long and how dense, not how it will look pixel
  for pixel.

## Provenance

Own practice, 2026-09: writing launch material for a batch of open-source skills, where the first drafts
included a number from a design doc instead of the measured log, a before/after GIF whose "after" was an
echo of a verdict rather than the tool's output, and a private project name in a gate's own source. Each of
those is now a gate rule or a procedure step. The card step (5) came last and for the same reason: the gate
had been reading the wrong line as the cover — the heading above it, four words long and always inside the
limit — for seven of thirteen kits, and it went on saying nothing until the cards were drawn and two covers
turned out to be over it. A check that reads the file can be looking at the wrong part of it; a picture of the result cannot.
